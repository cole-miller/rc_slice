This is a deprecated, unmaintained Rust library providing reference-counted
slice types.

If you're looking for a maintained library with similar functionality, you
could try [rc-slice2](https://crates.io/crates/rc-slice2), which is a fork of
this codebase with a new maintainer. I have not reviewed the fork and cannot
vouch for it personally, so you should evaluate it like you would any new
dependency.
